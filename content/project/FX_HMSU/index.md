abstract: "We examine the relationship between exchange rates and macroeconomic fundamentals using a
two-step maximum likelihood estimator through which we compute time-varying factor loadings.
Factors are obtained as principal components, extracted from a large macro-dataset. Using 14
currencies over 1995â€“2018, we show that the loadings on the factors vary considerably over time
with frequent sign changes. Allowing for time-varying loadings increases the percentage of explained
variation in exchanges rates by an order of magnitude. Accounting for instabilities improves the
predictive ability of the model globally and locally during crises, and yields better forecast of sign
changes in exchange rates."
