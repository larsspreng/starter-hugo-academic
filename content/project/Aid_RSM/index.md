Given the significant inflows of foreign aid to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) the possibility
of Dutch Disease has been a concern. Most macroeconomic models predict that aid
inflows, especially if large and/or unanticipated (shocks), will lead to an appreciation of
the real exchange rate and undermine the competitiveness of the economy. Empirical
evidence is inconclusive, but a common presumption is that aid has been associated with
Dutch Disease effects in SSA. Previous empirical studies rely on annual data and few
include data since the mid-2000s. This paper focuses on the more recent period employing
monthly time series data for ten countries over 2001 to 2017 to estimate a structural VAR.
For the majority of countries aid has no or a minimal effect on the real exchange rate;
there is evidence of a significant real appreciation in only two countries. Additional
analysis shows that commodity export prices are a more important determinant of the real
exchange rate, with an effect on average twice that of aid. The paper conjectures that the
absence of a Dutch Disease effect since the 2000s is due to a declining level of aid inflows
and improved macroeconomic management.
