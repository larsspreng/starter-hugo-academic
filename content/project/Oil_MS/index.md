summary: "This paper provides analysis of the macroeconomic management implications of becoming
an exporter of oil, taking the case of Ghana and applying to Uganda as a prospective
exporter. The paper proceeds in two steps. First, we construct a Dynamic Stochastic
General Equilibrium (DSGE) model of a primary commodity exporting developing
country calibrated to Ghana and Uganda and simulate the impulse response to shocks to
the oil price and oil production. Second, using parameters from the DSGE model to obtain
priors for parameter values, we use a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) with
monthly data over 2001 to 2019 to estimate the response to oil shocks as an importer for
both countries and as an exporter for Ghana after 2010. The DSGE results suggest that
although an oil price shock generates appreciation and initially output falls, there are
reductions in interest rates and inflation and ultimately output increases. The larger the oil
sector the greater the appreciation and inflationary effects, but output rises more quickly
and there are larger increases in wages and taxes. The SVAR results for Ghana when
exporting suggest an initial depreciation in response to an oil price shock, with a reduction
in inflation, but the immediate negative output response slowly turns positive (and becomes
consistent with the DSGE). When Ghana and Uganda are importers, oil price shocks
generate appreciation, mild inflation and interest rate reductions, so although output
declines initially it rises after a year and this persists. The analysis suggests that the adoption
of inflation targeting, in conjunction with an improved monitoring of macroeconomic
developments, has mitigated the effects of oil price shocks on domestic variables in Ghana
and Uganda."
